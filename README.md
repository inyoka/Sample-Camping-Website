# YelpCamp Website

The Web Developer Bootcamp Final Project.  Camp-Site review website based on Node.js, Express & MongoDB.
* NOTE: This is NOT an exact run-through.  Based on my experience I have used Flex for layout, not Bootstraps columns.  Also I have implemented Bootstrap 4, not 3.  Likely the project will deviate more as I progress.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install :

[Download Node.js from here.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing

1) Clone this git repository ...

```
git clone https://github.com/inyoka/yelpcamp.git
```
2) From inside the project directory run ...
```
npm install
```
... this will install the dependencies on **package.json**.

3) Start the server ...

```
node app.js
```
4) Use the IP address and port displayed in the console to open the site in Chrome.  By default this will be **127.0.0.1:8000**.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
